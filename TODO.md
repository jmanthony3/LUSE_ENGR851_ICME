# TODO
## Repository
- [ ] Move `~/Calculations/` scripts to be copied from `~/Files/`: this will preserve user-edits upon "fetch"
- [ ] Fill in docs for concepts of each bridge.
  - [ ] Bridge 1: Electronics to Atomistics
  - [ ] Bridge 2: Atomistics to Dislocation Mobility
  - [ ] Bridge 3: Dislocation Mobility to Crystal Plasticity
- [x] ~~Uses GitHub actions and YAML to build docs.~~ Workflow solved in [511aed](https://github.com/jmanthony3/LUSE_ENGR851_ICME/commit/511aedb11cea162de1cb2069f8115858e62811aa)
- [ ] Add instructions for installing MATLAB tools.

## Bridges
- [ ] Is visual inspection for convergence sufficient for `~/1-ElectronicsToAtomistics/Calculations/2-KPointStudy/which_ecutwfc.<ext>`; could this be automated?
