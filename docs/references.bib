  abstract = {Low temperature irradiation of crystalline materials is known to result in hardening and loss of ductility, which limits the usefulness of candidate materials in harsh nuclear environments. In body-centered cubic (bcc) metals, this mechanical property degradation is caused by the interaction of in-grown dislocations with irradiation defects, particularly small dislocation loops resulting from the microstructural evolution of displacement cascades. In this paper, we perform dislocation dynamics simulations of bcc Fe containing various concentrations of dislocation loops produced by irradiation in an attempt to gain insight into the processes that lead to hardening and embrittlement. We find that a transition from homogenous to highly localized deformation occurs at a critical loop density. Above it, plastic flow proceeds heterogeneously, creating defect-free channels in its wake. We find that channel initiation and size are mediated by loop coalescence resulting from elastic interactions with moving dislocations.},

The current version of the MSU ISV DMG model (55p-v1p1) is specified by 55 constants. Some of these constants, like bulk modulus, shear modulus, and melting temperature, are fixed for a given material and may be obtained from the literature. Other constants, such as average radius of voids, average size of particles, and average grain size, are measured from characterization experiments on samples of the material. The remaining constants are fitted, using DMGfit, from stress-strain data from experiments on the samples.},

The simulations are conducted at temperatures ranging between 300\,K and 900\,K and strain rate ranging between 102 to107 s-1. Atomistically informed generalized mobility law was incorporated in MDDP to account for the effects of temperature and strain rate on dislocation mobility, lattice friction and elastic constants. MDDP based constitutive equations interrelating temperature and strain rate with the flow stress at high strain rate shock-less and shock conditions are proposed. The simulation results of the temperature and strain rate dependent yield strength and Hugoniot elastic limit are in good agreement with reported experimental results. Detailed investigations of the dislocation microstructure evolution show the formation of extended screw dislocation lines at temperatures below 340\,K due to the large value of the lattice friction of the pure screw segments. Moreover, small sessile loops of radius in the order of few nanometers are formed. The formation of these sessile loops is facilitated by the easiness of multiple cross slip on available slip planes.},

Written by one of the world's leading ICME experts, this text delivers a comprehensive, practical introduction to the field, guiding readers through multiscale materials processing modeling and simulation with easy-to-follow explanations and examples. Following an introductory chapter exploring the core concepts and the various disciplines that have contributed to the development of ICME, the text covers the following important topics with their associated length scale bridging methodologies: Macroscale continuum internal state variable plasticity and damage theory and multistage fatigue Mesoscale analysis: continuum theory methods with discrete features and methods Discrete dislocation dynamics simulations Atomistic modeling methods Electronics structures calculations Next, the author provides three chapters dedicated to detailed case studies, including "From Atoms to Autos: A Redesign of a Cadillac Control Arm," that show how the principles and methods of ICME work in practice. The final chapter examines the future of ICME, forecasting the development of new materials and engineering structures with the help of a cyberinfrastructure that has been recently established. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) for Metals is recommended for both students and professionals in engineering and materials science, providing them with new state-of-the-technology tools for selecting, designing, optimizing, and manufacturing new materials. Instructors who adopt this text for coursework can take advantage of PowerPoint lecture notes, a questions and solutions manual, and tutorials to guide students through the models and codes discussed in the text.},

The MEAM parameters for element pairs were constructed based on the structural and elastic properties of element pairs in the NaCl reference structure garnered from ab-initio calculations, with adjustment to reproduce the ab-initio heat of formation of the most stable binary compounds. The new MEAM potentials were validated by comparing the formation energies of defects, equilibrium volumes, elastic moduli, and heat of formation for several binary compounds with ab-initio simulations and experiments. Single elements in their ground state crystal structure were subjected to heating to test the potentials at elevated temperatures. An Al potential was modified to avoid formation of an unphysical solid structure at high temperatures. The thermal expansion coefficient of a compound with the composition of AA 6061 alloy was evaluated and compared with experimental values. MEAM potential tests performed in this work, utilizing the universal Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE), are distributed to facilitate reproducibility of the results.},

The dislocation density evolution law in this model is mechanism-based, with parameters predicted by lower-length scale models or measured from experiments, not an empirical law with parameters back-fitted from the flow curves. Applied on iron single crystal, this model was validated by experimental data and compared with traditional single crystal constitutive models using a Hutchinson-type hardening law or a dislocation-based hardening law. The CDD model demonstrated higher fidelity than other constitutive models when anisotropic single crystal deformation behaviors were investigated. The traditional Hutchinson type hardening laws and other constitutive laws based on a Kocks formulated dislocation density evolution law will only succeed in a limited number of loading directions. The main advantage of CDD is the novel physics-based dislocation density evolution laws in describing the meso-scale microstructure evolution. Another advantage of CDD is on cross-slip, which is very important when loading conditions activate only one primary slip system. In addition to the dislocation hardening, CDD also takes into consideration dislocation defect interactions. Irradiation hardening of iron single crystal was simulated with validation from experimental results.},

  abstract = {We compute the lattice-dynamical and thermal equation of state properties of ferromagnetic bcc iron using the first principles linear response linear-muffin-tin-orbital method in the generalized-gradient approximation. The calculated phonon dispersion and phonon density of states, both at ambient and high pressures, show good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data. We find the free energy as a function of volume and temperature, including both electronic excitations and phonon contributions, and we have derived various thermodynamic properties at high pressure and temperature. The thermal equation of state at ambient temperature agrees well with diamond-anvil-cell measurements. We have performed detailed investigations on the behavior of various thermal equation of state parameters, such as the bulk modulus, the thermal expansivity, the Anderson-Gruneisen parameter, the Gruneisen ratio, and the heat capacity as function of temperature and pressure. A detailed comparison has been made with available experimental measurements, as well as results from similar theoretical studies on nonmagnetic bcc Tantalum.
