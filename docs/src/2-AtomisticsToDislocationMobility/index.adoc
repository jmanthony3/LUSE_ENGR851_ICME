= 2-AtomisticsToDislocationMobility
This length scale requires the use of pseudopotential files as input to Quantum Espresso to dictate how electronic energies are calculated (discussed in detail link:./2-AtomisticsToDislocationMobility/index.html[here]).
Visit any of the following for a pseudopotential file of choice:
